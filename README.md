# Machine Learning Course Overview

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a Machine Learning Course that covers foundational to advanced topics. Through weekly modules, participants gain hands-on experience with ML libraries, regression techniques, classifiers, deep learning frameworks, and image processing. The course culminates with a project on Facial Recognition using Siamese Neural Networks.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Machine Learning Basics
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- **Topics**:
  - Linear Regression for data relationships.
  - Logistic Regression for binary classification.
  - Intro to Classifiers.

### Week 2: Deep Learning Fundamentals
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **Topics**:
  - Neural Networks basics.
  - YOLOv8 for object detection/classification.
  - Optional: Revisit Classifiers.

### Week 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Tools**: OpenCV for image preprocessing (resize, normalize, noise removal).
- **Topics**:
  - CNNs for image-based tasks.

## Project 1: Facial Recognition
- **Focus**: Siamese Neural Networks.
- **Task**: Implement a system to verify if two images match.
  - Use your own image as the base.
  - Compare it with another image.
